              {BRAND.short} began with a single overcoat pattern and a mill in northern Portugal.
              Ten seasons later the method is unchanged: choose the cloth first, cut it slowly,
              produce only what we can sell.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every style is made in runs of a few hundred. When a fabric is finished, the piece is
              retired rather than reproduced in a lesser quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our studio is in Lisbon, with a showroom open by appointment. Repairs are offered free
              for the first two years on all outerwear.
